# 09 Travis CI

In this sample we are going to create Travis CI configuration.

We will start from sample _08 Reselect_.

Summary steps:
 - See `Travis CI` web page.
 - Create repository.
 - Add `.travis.yml` config file.

# Steps to build it

- `npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```bash
npm install
```

- If we take a look to [`Travis CI pricing`](https://travis-ci.com/plans) we could see that we have free CI for open sources projects.

- So, we need to upload our work in a Github repository and link `Travis CI` with our Github account.

- We are going to create a branch in this repository to add `.travis.yml` config file:

> [Building travis file for Node](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/)

### ./.travis.yml
```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "8"
install:
  - npm install
script:
  - npm test
```

- Commit, push and create a pull request.

- To link this repository with Travis, we have to add it in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org).

- Now a CI build is running once we merge to master, but if we create a new branch and related pull request, we could see that Travis builds are running on PRs too.
